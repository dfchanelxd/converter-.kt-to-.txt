# 🚀 KT to TXT Converter (Web-Based)

A modern, fast, and secure web tool to convert Kotlin Source Files (`.kt`) into Plain Text (`.txt`) directly in your browser.

## 🤔 Why use this tool instead of renaming manually?

While you can technically rename files manually, this tool offers superior workflow advantages:

1.  **Mobile Convenience:** Changing file extensions on mobile devices (Android/iOS) is often tedious and requires specific file manager steps. This web app makes it instant.
2.  **Non-Destructive:** It creates a **new** `.txt` copy, keeping your original `.kt` source code safe and untouched.
3.  **OS Independent:** No need to worry about "Hidden File Extensions" settings in Windows or permission issues in macOS/Linux.
4.  **100% Privacy (Client-Side):**
    *   🔒 **No Server Uploads:** All conversions happen locally in your browser using JavaScript `FileReader`.
    *   Your code **never** leaves your device.
    *   Works **Offline** without an internet connection.

## ✨ Features
*   **Glassmorphism UI:** A sleek, modern interface with smooth animations.
*   **Drag & Drop:** Easy file selection.
*   **Instant Conversion:** Zero latency processing.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  Drag and drop your `.kt` file.
3.  Click **"Convert & Download"**.
4.  Done!
