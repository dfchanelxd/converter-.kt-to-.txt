# 💻 Simple KT to TXT Converter 

**A Fast, Secure, and Browser-Based Utility**

Welcome to the repository for the **KT to TXT Converter**! This is a simple, modern web tool designed to convert your Kotlin Source Files (`.kt`) into plain text files (`.txt`) right in your browser. Perfect for easy viewing, sharing, or creating code snippets.

## ✨ Features

* **100% Client-Side:** Your code is safe! All conversions happen *locally* within your browser using JavaScript's FileReader. Your file **never** leaves your device.
* **Offline Support:** Works perfectly even without an internet connection.

* **Modern UI:** Built with a sleek interface featuring smooth animations (Glassmorphism style).
* **Instant & Easy:** Supports Drag & Drop for quick file selection and offers zero-latency, instant conversion.
