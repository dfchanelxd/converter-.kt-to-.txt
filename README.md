# 💻 Simple KT to TXT Converter

**Fast, Secure, and Browser-Based Utility**

Welcome to the repository for the **KT to TXT Converter**! This is a simple, modern web tool designed to convert your Kotlin Source Files (`.kt`) into plain text files (`.txt`) right in your browser. It is perfectly suited for viewing, sharing, or creating code snippets with ease.

## ✨ Key Features

* **100% Client-Side:** Your code is safe! All conversions happen **locally** within your browser using JavaScript FileReader. Your file **never** leaves your device.
* **Offline Support:** Works perfectly even without an internet connection.
* **Non-Destructive:** This tool creates an entirely new `.txt` copy, ensuring your original `.kt` source file remains safe and untouched.
* **Modern UI:** Built with a sleek interface and smooth animations (Glassmorphism style).
* **Instant & Easy:** Supports the *Drag & Drop* feature for quick file selection and offers instant processing without *latency*.

## ❓ Why use this instead of renaming the file manually?

While you *could* change the file extension manually, this tool offers significant workflow advantages:

1. **Mobile Convenience:** Changing file extensions on mobile devices (Android/iOS) is often complicated and requires specific file manager steps. This web application makes it instant.
2. **Safe & Clean:** You get a clean text copy without having to worry about backup or accidentally modifying the original source code.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Visit the KT to TXT web application at: [Converter Web Link](https://dfchanelxd.github.io/converter-.kt-to-.txt/index.html)
2. Drag and drop your desired `.kt` file onto the application page.
3. Click the 'Convert & Download' button.
4. Done! Your `.txt` file is ready.
